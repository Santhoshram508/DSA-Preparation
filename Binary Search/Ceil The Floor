Given an unsorted array arr[] of integers and an integer x, find the floor and ceiling of x in arr[].

Floor of x is the largest element which is smaller than or equal to x. Floor of x doesn’t exist if x is smaller than smallest element of arr[].
Ceil of x is the smallest element which is greater than or equal to x. Ceil of x doesn’t exist if x is greater than greatest element of arr[].

Return an array of integers denoting the [floor, ceil]. Return -1 for floor or ceiling if the floor or ceiling is not present.

Examples:

Input: x = 7 , arr[] = [5, 6, 8, 9, 6, 5, 5, 6]
Output: 6, 8
Explanation: Floor of 7 is 6 and ceil of 7 is 8.
Input: x = 10 , arr[] = [5, 6, 8, 8, 6, 5, 5, 6]
Output: 8, -1
Explanation: Floor of 10 is 8 but ceil of 10 is not possible.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints :
1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i], x ≤ 106

Code:

class Solution {
    public int[] getFloorAndCeil(int x, int[] arr) {
           int floor = -1;
        int ceil = -1;
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num <= x) {
                floor = Math.max(floor, num);
            }
            if (num >= x) {
                ceil = (ceil == -1) ? num : Math.min(ceil, num);
            }
        }
        
        return new int[]{floor, ceil};
    
    }
}

Condition Check: if (num >= x)

This checks if the value of num is greater than or equal to x.
Ternary Operator: ceil = (ceil == -1) ? num : Math.min(ceil, num);

This line uses a ternary operator to assign a value to ceil.
Condition: (ceil == -1)
If ceil is -1, it means ceil has not been set yet (assuming -1 is used as an initial value to indicate this).
True Case: num
If ceil is -1, assign num to ceil.
False Case: Math.min(ceil, num)
If ceil is not -1, assign the smaller value between ceil and num to ceil.
Summary:
If num is greater than or equal to x, the code checks if ceil is -1.
If ceil is -1, it sets ceil to num.
Otherwise, it sets ceil to the smaller value between the current ceil and num.
This logic is often used to find the smallest number greater than or equal to x in a list of numbers.
